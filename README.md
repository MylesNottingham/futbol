# Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.

# Deliverables
Your iteration deliverable is to create a README with the following. As you craft your answers, consider how you might talk about these same topics in a job interview after you graduate.

A 1-2 summary or bullet points outlining your plan for check-ins throughout the duration of the project.

A 2-4 sentence summary of your plan for project organization and workflow. This can include bullet points. If you plan to use a project management tool, please include a link to your project board.

A 2-3 sentence summary describing the different approaches your group discussed for project organization and how you collectively made a decision on which to use.

A 2-3 sentence summary describing your approach to the code design.

Include link to your initial DTR document and the date it was completed. If you do additional DTRs later in the project, you should link the revised versions here as well with the date. New versions should be listed alongside older versions. Do not delete old DTRs.

Create a section in your README called ‚ÄúContributors‚Äù. List each group member‚Äôs name and link to their LinkedIn and Github profiles.

# Project DTR

[Google Doc Draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1740HuAFLi1xVROgF36FxYxkCJI31Z3uT3scIvu9LqoA/edit?usp=sharing)

**DTR: Define The Relationship**
Your project has the potential to be amazing. The way you set expectations for communication, feedback, and working styles is critical to create an amazing product. We call this process DTR -- Define the Relationship. The more detailed and specific you can be at the start, the better your full instructional team will work together.

## Recommended Process

DTR with your team BEFORE you begin work
Return to the DTR at the end of your first working session
Return to your DTR any time you come into a team conflict

### BEFORE YOU START THE PROJECT

**DTR: Essential Questions to Discuss**
*What are your learning goals for the project?*

- Matt: learn how to work collaboratively in github with multiple people
- Javen: Learn how to have a workflow with more than 2 people and still be productive
- Garrett: learn how to work collaboratively in github with multiple people and deal with merge conflicts should they arise, learn how to project manage across a large group
- Myles: Learn a new project management tool

*What do I offer the team?*

- Matt: unusual solutions, schedule management, trello?

*How do you learn best with coding? How do you like to collaborate with others?*
*Do you like to work alone first?*

- Matt:  no i like to get a high level overview with everyone to make sure we are on the same page then start working.
- Javen: I learn best by seeing something implemented in a real case scenario, and then I like to try it myself. I like to do the same as Matt as well.
- Garrett: I like to first pseudocode and think about what I‚Äôm trying to do, and then test around in pry to ensure that I‚Äôm getting what I‚Äôm expecting
- Myles: I prefer to work alone once we have established goals as a group.

*Do you like to speak out loud as you are learning?*

- Matt: for sure
- Javen: I like to try and repeat what is said so It actually goes through my head.
- Garrett: I do, and I try to be conscious to not overwhelm the other person and let the other person have space for their thoughts first

- Garrett: I like to have things written down or recorded to refer back to
- Myles: I prefer higher-fidelity, synchronous forms of communication for more complex problems and lower-fidelity, asynchronous communication for simpler issues.

*How do you appreciate receiving feedback from others?*

- Matt: i like to receive honest feedback and am always open to critique
- Javen: As soon as possible and whenever convenient. You won‚Äôt hurt my feelings I promise
- Garrett: I appreciate receiving critical feedback one on one with others; in terms of technical feedback, I like when others give feedback in the moment
- Myles: Praise in public and criticize in private.

*How do you best give feedback to others?*

- Matt:
- Javen: I can type a message out pretty well but if you prefer one on one, face to face I can do that
- Garrett: I like to give feedback one on on in person whenever that feels ok to the other person, otherwise I‚Äôm happy to deliver feedback asynchronously via slack, etc.
- Myles: I prefer to give feedback with a high-fidelity channel so that body language and tone are understood.

## Project Management

- Point people:
  - Project Management: Javen
  - Readme: Garrett
  - Github Repo: Myles
  - Everything else: Matttttttttttttt

## Conventions

**Rubocop**
Double or single quotes?
Anything else?

### Naming conventions:

*How to Write a Good Commit Message*

Begin the commit message with the type of the commit followed by a : and brief description.

#### Types of commits include:

`fix` - use if committed code is fixing a bug(broken code).

`feat` - stands for feature. This will likely be your most common type that you use. It should be used for any new functionality that is committed.

`test` - use if committed code is adding test functionality.

`refactor` - use if updating and/or removing existing code.

`docs` - use if updating your readme.
*Examples of good commit messages:*

```bash
git commit -m "Fix: Broken calculation for percent high ranking cards"
git commit -m "Feat: Add shuffle to deck"
git commit -m "Test: Add test for shuffle"
```

Spec Harness: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/futbol_spec_harness


### Branch naming conventions:

Conventionally starts with prefix of feature/ or refactor/ or fix/
Do not use the word ‚Äòiteration‚Äô - instead describe what work is being tackled in that iteration
Should be able to see a high level view of your approach to the project

  - Did we discuss those behaviors in our DTR?
  - What language should I use to communicate this challenge?

### Team Discussion:

- Identify the problem/challenge that needs to be solved
- What are the behaviors happening?
- How could we update our DTR to address this?
- What actions can we all take to move forward?
